fri,12:00,12:20,Old School cache coherence - a snooping system for a multicore processor based on CVA6,Massimiliano Giacometti ,PlanV GmbH ,talk,"For many years now the computational power required by modern applications can only be offered by a collection of CPUs working together in a multicore processor. For these CPUs to process information correctly, it is necessary to implement mechanisms which guarantee that each core always uses an up-to-date version of the data: cache coherence protocols have been developed with this purpose. 
Years ago, when silicon technology could support the integration of only a handful of CPUs per chip, cache coherence was achieved by implementing bus snooping mechanisms; nowadays the propensity is to make use of directory-based cache coherence mechanisms, which guarantee excellent scalability, at the expense speed. This trend can be confirmed also by looking at the existing open-source implementations: there is not a single snooping mechanism. This is a problem, because many real-world scenarios would benefit from a low latency cache coherence unit, for example for all processors integrating a limited number of CPUs.
With Culsans our goal is to cover this gap, by developing an open-source, tightly-coupled, low latency cache coherence unit for a quad-core processor based on the popular RISC-V CPU CVA6.
In this presentation we show the architecture and the performance of the proposed implementation.","Founder and Managing Director of PlanV, Massimiliano is a RISC-V and open-source enthusiast: he has been working as hardware designer for his entire career, having contributed to a wide range of projects and products, from signal processing and communication systems to computer architectures.

In addition, VP models can be extended to provide information for early architectural analysis. Based on SystemC, specifically TLM2 based modeling, VPs can offer simulations of complete hardware platforms with significantly higher speeds and less overhead than RTL simulations. Using productivity libraries has a significant impact on the development effort. But often such productivity libraries are tied into vendor specific tooling. We will show an alternative approach based on open-source libraries. The analysis process can also be significantly eased with the use of open-source analysis packages. We will show how we use open-source Python libraries to analyze results from VP and early architecture simulations.

Based on the SystemC hardware modeling language, VPs can offer fast simulations of complete hardware platforms (e.g., System-on-Chip (SoC)) executing bare metal applications, operating systems and more (10x to 100x faster than RTL simulations).
With the Group of Computer Architecture (AGRA) at the University of Bremen, our research focuses on methods and techniques for the design and verification of VP-based Software and Hardware.
To bridge the gap between the VP and the real-world Hardware, methods crossing the abstraction layers (e.g., from the VP to the RTL) is a promising approach for verification.
While utilizing available open source tools, we take part in releasing our tooling as open source to enable further research and offer accessible educational tools (VPs, RTL implementation, verification tools, etc.).

fri,14:00,14:20,RADOPA: Robustifying a Design Against Optical Probing Attacks,Sajjad Parvin,University of Bremen,talk," Recent studies revealed that laser-based side channel attack methods, especially Optical Probing (OP), pose a serious threat to the security of integrated circuits. State-of-the-art countermeasures focus mainly on approaches in the domain of circuit design, and lack appropriate analysis methods that can be employed during design time. Consequently, the actual robustness against OP can only be tested during post-fabrication, which might lead to the necessity of IC redesign. To mitigate this problem, we propose the framework RADOPA that enables already during design time exploring the circuit’s susceptibility against OP. The main elements of this framework are reading layout file, performing logical computation, and performing various OP analysis such as retrieving internal waveform of chips, and creating activity map of area of interest on chip.
The applicability of our framework, namely RADOPA is explored by designing and verifying a cell library and exemplary circuits that are robust against OP attacks. We will demonstrate OP on cell libraries based on a 45nm open-source PDK and its standard cell library, and provide a guide on how to robustify a design against OP attacks. Moreover, we evaluate layout design techniques that can alleviate the OP attacks. We will provide all the explored cell libraries in this work and the core engine to perform OP in order to replicate the results publicly available. As a future plan, we are aiming to make our tool source files publicly available.

Schneider,"Infineon Technologies AG, Leibniz Universität Hannover",talk,"Timers are an integral part of most processors, serving essential tasks such as preemptive context switching or reading sensor values at specific time intervals.
The RISC-V specification defines the mtime counter as part of their High-Performance-Counter facility to provide RISC-V processors with a stable wall-clock time. This counter is unique, however, as it is the only counter that is accessed through memory-mapped registers instead of control and status registers (CSRs). This has implications for the design of the mtime counter, making it challenging to find a design that best fits the project's requirements.
Within this presentation, the mtime counter is explained and multiple design strategies of the mtime counter are shown and compared to each other.
Furthermore, a modified mtime counter is proposed that exclusively relies on a CSR-based implementation.
Such CSR-based implementations exhibit greater consistency within the High-Performance-Counter facility and are generally more lightweight in terms of area and access time than their memory-mapped counterparts. This makes them particularly well-suited for deeply-embedded cores where known operation conditions can be utilized to achieve smaller core area.","Viktor Schneider is a master's student in Computer Engineering at Leibniz Universität Hannover.

Several discoveries of recent years include Pulsars, Fast Radio Bursts and the magnetic interaction between stars and their planets. Contrary to an optical telescope, a radio telescope observes a range of radio signals outside the optical spectrum. Today's radio telescope systems consist of several to many antennas which are computationally combined into one large radio telescope.

To enable more groundbreaking research, even better systems are needed to reveal more details of the universe. At the same time, there is a pressing need to improve the material cost and energy efficiency of systems.

These models play a central role in system design and are often created using tools like MATLAB© and Octave, which offer a wide range of built-in functions. However, hardware design, particularly the verification process, requires specialized skills and tools like SystemVerilog.

To address this, we have developed a package called MathLib, which extends standard SystemVerilog to include mathematical function modeling. In this paper, we present a selection of MATLAB functions and their equivalents implemented in MathLib. This approach offers several key advantages:

1. Native SystemVerilog implementation: By integrating mathematical functions directly into SystemVerilog, we eliminate the need for external tools or dependencies, streamlining the design process.

2. Cost savings: Since MathLib enables native implementation in SystemVerilog, it eliminates the need for additional licenses or software, resulting in cost savings for the users.

Furthermore, we provide a real-world example of how MathLib was utilized in one of our recent customer projects. We demonstrate how we employed MathLib to model complex equations within native SystemVerilog, showcasing its practical application. Additionally, we share insights from deploying this library in a few analog and mixed-signal (AMS) designs, specifically in the development of designs such as low-dropout regulators (LDOs) and low-pass filters (LPFs).

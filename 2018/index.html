                As is tradition at ORConf, a dinner will be arranged for the Saturday evening (22nd) which all conference attendees and partners are encouraged to attend.

              <p>This year the dinner is sponsored by <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a> and will take place at <a href="http://www.brovarnia.pl/">Brovarnia Gdansk</a>.

	      <h5>Getting to the venue</h5>
	      <p>
		You can reach the conference venue from the airport (or any other place of the city):
		<ul>
		  <li>take any train SKM/PKM direction Gdansk Wrzeszcz or Gdansk Środmiesice, get off at Gdansk Wrzeszcz (20 min. from the airport)</li>
		  <li>bus 164 (direction  Kiełpinek PKM, stop "Siedlicka"), bus 168 (direction Kiełpino Górne, stop "Siedlicka"), 115 (direction Dworzec Główny, stop "Teatr Miniatura / Radio Gdańsk"), or just <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Gda%C5%84sk+Wrzeszcz,+Dmowskiego+1A,+80-001+Gda%C5%84sk/ETI,+Genera%C5%82a+J%C3%B3zefa+Fiszera,+Gda%C5%84sk/@54.3778048,18.6058089,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x46fd74bffc1ed5e9:0x8eecfc8da898b929!2m2!1d18.6049595!2d54.3815684!1m5!1m1!1s0x46fd7490cfa4ebe7:0x9017aadf9a5fd79b!2m2!1d18.6139486!2d54.3740414!3e2!5m1!1e1">walk</a> (ca. 16 min)
		</ul>
		<p>If you arrive by railway: get off at Gdansk Wrzeszcz and take any of the buses mentioned above or walk.</p>
	      </p>
	      <h5>Getting around</h5>
	      <p class="card-text">
		You can also take a taxi or Uber. I recommend any of those: MyTaxi, Hallo Taxi, Neptun Taxi, As Taxi, Dajan Taxi. Avoid non corporation taxis.
	      </p>

	      <p class="card-text">
		This is the <a href="http://www.mzkzg.org/?subpage=pod&art=35&op=%2C%2C%2C">website</a> for public transport. There is a very good planner: <a href="https://jakdojade.pl">https://jakdojade.pl</a> (english version after clicking "gear" in the  upper right corner).
	      </p>
	      <p class="card-text">
		If you install mobile app "Jakdojade", there is also a possibility to buy tickets for train and buses (MZKG):
		<ul>
		  <li>Single ride: 3PLN (ONE RIDE)</li>
		  <li>1-hour ticket: 3.80 PLN (1 HOUR MZKG)</li>
		  <li>24-hour ticket: 23 PLN (24 HOURS MZKG)</li>
		  <li>72-hour ticket: 46 PLN (72 HOURS MZKG)</li>
		</ul>
		There are also ticket machines at selected places. In trains you validate tickets at the platform before entering the train. In buses you validate tickets inside the bus. Generally it is complicated (but possible) to buy tickets directly inside a train or bus - there are many rules you have to follow: in the train you need to go immediately to the conductor, they may charge you extra, if there was no possibility to buy tickets at station, in the bus - go directly to the driver, you need to have EXACT amount in PLN, then you need to validate the ticket.
	      </p>
	      <p class="card-text">
		There is also a 3-day ticket for city trains on SKM/PKM line (no tram or buses!) valid 72 hours. You need to go to <a href="https://bilety.skm.pkp.pl/en/">their website</a>, then select "Bilety strefowe" / "Bilet Trzydobowy Gdańsk — Wejherowo 28 zł" (=Zonal ticket, 3 days) choose: Discount "Bilet normalny" (=normal ticket, no discount) then you can pay by Visa/Mastercard. Probably you need to print the ticket (I did not try to buy)  and you must have ID or passport with the same name as on the ticket.
	      </p>
	      <h5>Getting to Gdansk</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Gdansk has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk_Lech_Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa_Airport" target="_blank">international airport</a> and is served by by both major and low-cost airlines, but usefully is a hub for both <a href="https://www.ryanair.com/sr/en/plan-trip/destinations/flights-to-gdansk" target="_blank">Ryanair</a> and <a href="https://wizzair.com/en-gb/flights/flights-to-gdansk" target="_blank">Wizzair</a>, making it a very affordable city to fly to from most of Europe.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                There is a rail line from the aiport into the city which should make transferring from the aiport to accommodation pretty easy. There are further details on this on the <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Gda%C5%84sk#Get_in" target="_blank">Wikitravel</a> page for Gdansk, from which most of this information is cribbed.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Gdansk is also very accessible by rail from all of Europe
              </p>
              <h5>Accommodation</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Below are some accommodation options for the conference.
              </p>
              <h6>Focus Hotel</h6>
              <p class="card-text">
                The Focus Hotel close to the Gdansk University of Technology
            (a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Focus+Hotel+Premium+Gda%C5%84sk,+Nad+Stawem,+Gda%C5%84sk,+Poland/Gda%C5%84sk+University+of+Technology,+Gabriela+Narutowicza+11%2F12,+80-233+Gda%C5%84sk,+Poland/@54.3777406,18.6018538,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x46fd74c06d9441b7:0xf249873b374e3df0!2m2!1d18.6046961!2d54.383439!1m5!1m1!1s0x46fd74905b613ac3:0x7d834113ccd9a883!2m2!1d18.6163277!2d54.3716751!3e2" target="_blank">25 minute walk to the conference</a>)
                has an offer of a special rate for ORConf visitors this year:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To obtain the offer, go to <a href="http://www.focushotels.pl/wydarzenia,165.html" target="_blank">http://www.focushotels.pl/wydarzenia,165.html</a>, and click on the "<strong>Rezerwuj</strong>" button next to the ORConf logo.</li>
                <li>Once you see the date selection popup, click on "<strong>Switch to English</strong>" at the top which will make things easier for non-Polish speakers.</li>
                <li>Next, and crucially, you'll see a link reading "<strong>Enter Code</strong>" at the top of the window which should now say "Plan your stay". Click on "Enter Code" and enter <strong>ORCONF2018</strong>.</li>
                <li>You will then see the dates are limited to the dates surrounding ORConf.</li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Hotels.com</h6>
              <p class="card-text">
                There are <a href="https://www.hotels.com/search.do?resolved-location=CITY%3A1028414%3AUNKNOWN%3AUNKNOWN&destination-id=1028414&q-destination=Gdansk,%20Poland&q-check-in=2018-09-21&q-check-out=2018-09-23&q-rooms=1&q-room-0-adults=1&q-room-0-children=0" target="_blank">numerous options on Hotels.com</a>
                including <a href="https://www.hotels.com/ho340719/?q-check-out=2018-09-23&FPQ=2&q-check-in=2018-09-21&WOE=7&WOD=5&q-room-0-children=0&tab=description&JHR=2&q-room-0-adults=1&YGF=14&MGT=2&ZSX=0&SYE=3" target="_blank">Hotel Impresja</a>
                which appears to be about as far from the conference venue as Focus.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                There is a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/gda%C5%84sk+University+of+Technology/@54.3740325,18.6253874,16.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46fd749eb7d370dd:0x99f979cdf1c1cba9!8m2!3d54.3743873!4d18.6268432" target="_blank">train station for the University (Gdansk Politechnika)</a> which should mean that anyone staying closer to town within reach of a train station should be able to access the venue relatively easily without a taxi.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Trains from Gdansk Central Station (Gdansk Glowny) run about every 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes, until about 10PM at night. So hotels near there would likely be fine as well.

              <p>
                RISC-V CPU Project in Western Digital: from embedded cores for SSD Flash controllers to vision of datacenter processors with open memory and accelerator interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> Instruction Set Architecture has established itself as key driver of
                open source hardware projects across wide gamut of applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) segment,
                microcontrollers for a variety of traditional embedded applications, and applications requiring capability for
                low power operation of inference engines based on artificial neural networks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In <a href="https://www.wdc.com/" target="_blank">Western Digital</a>, we have developed super-scalar (2-way)
                9-stage pipeline mostly in-order, open-source core ECHX1, initially targeting in-house embedded Storage System on Chip
                applications. In this presentation, we plan to present some of the architectural details of the core, and challenges
                in the implementations, as well as discuss application of the core for the Flash controller. Additionally, we will
                explain the vision for expansion of RISC-V cores into datacenter and enterprise market.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will also discuss open interfaces for persistent memories, such as JEDEC-standardized NVDIMM-P
                (Non-volatile dual inline memory module for persistent memories). We will also introduce exporting
                open cache-coherence protocols (such as Tilelink) over ubiquitous fabrics such as Ethernet.
                We plan to discuss details of the MPF4brik – memory protocol fabrik, which exposes Tilelink on
                the Ethernet, and allows smart switching using P4-based programmable networking. We are envisioning
                low-cost SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) architectures based on open standards, which will enable
                hyperconvergence of processing and memory in the future datacenter, and introduce new concepts, such as
                memory appliances.

                It is retargetable, meaning it can be ported to other FPGA
                architectures easily, uses timing-driven algorithms, provides a python scripting API, supports complex
                placement and floorplanning constraints, and has a nice GUI. Python and GUI support are optional, which
                may be useful when deploying nextpnr on an embedded platform.

          <p>
            <a href="https://opensocdebug.org/" target="_blank">Open SoC Debug</a> (OSD) is a complete solution
            for adding debug and trace to a SoC design. It consists of a solid specification, a software and a
            hardware implementation and supports tracing of CPU cores (RISC-V and OpenRISC currently), memory access
            (to load your software into the chip), UART emulation, and much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the last year much effort has been put into the specification and the implementation.
            New concepts (such as subnets) have been introduced, the software implementation has been fully
            rewritten and is now more robust than ever, and the hardware has gained significant test coverage
            (and bug fixing). In addition, run-control debugging is being worked on as part of Google Summer of Code.

            <a name="zipcpu" href="#zipcpu"></a>Lessons learned while formally verifying the ZipCPU</h4>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://zipcpu.com/" target="_blank">ZipCPU</a> is a three-year old CPU and ISA designed for
            low logic FPGA's.  One of the challenges
            of any CPU design, to include the ZipCPU, is coming up with a sufficiently robust test suite to exercise
            all of the possible logic flows within the CPU.  While formal methods can be used for this task, they are
            traditionally viewed as too computationally expensive to formally verify something as complex as a CPU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to this view, the ZipCPU has now been formally verified
            using <a href="http://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
            target="_blank">SymbiYosys</a>. As a result, many bugs have been found and fixed--bugs
            not found previously using canned test cases.  Not only that, it has also become easier
            to modify the CPU as necessary to achieve lower logic utilization, knowing that the
            formal solver will find any bugs in the updated implementations.

            successfully evaluated feasibility and implemented most of User-Level ISA and partly
            Privileged Architecture specification. Their work will be further continued to achieve
            full RISC-V compliance. Our future plans are to develop a low-power single stage RISC-V

            <a href="http://www.clash-lang.org/" target="_blank">Clash</a> is an effort to build a compiler
            translating Haskell to Verilog and VHDL. It
            supports many of Haskell's incredibly powerful constructs, allowing it to reuse much of
            the existing ecosystem. Clash supports powerful type inference, an interactive REPL,
            simulation on any target supported by GHC, abstract data types, and higher-order
            functions. Many hardware features are supported or under active development, such as
            verilog co-simulation, multiple clock domains, and bidirectional ports.
          </p>

            transforming the way ASICs and FPGAs are being perceived, designed and worked

            We would like to introduce our Libre Silicon project, who we are, what we are doing and where we are now.
            While a lot of projects are currently developing their own processors, mostly as open source in Verilog,
            VHDL or even Chisel, we miss the free process afterwards to manufacture this chips.
          </p>
          <p>
            The manufacturing is proprietary and has vendor lock-ins with triple NDAs - one for the
            ""process development kit"" (PDK) , the technology itself; - one for the Standard Cell Library you can use
            to synthesis your RTL; - and even another one for the details of all purchase commitments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our purpose is a free and open, community based silicon manufacturing process
            (<a href="https://github.com/libresilicon/process" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>) without
            any NDAs, a Standard Cell Library (<a href="https://github.com/chipforge/StdCellLib" blank="_blank">GitHub link</a>)
              not only for that process as well as the a suitable, refurbished, new-written open source tool chain
              (<a href="https://github.com/leviathanch/qtflow" target="_blank">qtflow</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            During the last couple of month we already developed a first 1um process and are now close to manufacturing
            a first test waver (<a href="https://github.com/chipforge/PearlRiver" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>). Well,
            1um does not sounds very ambitious, but this process node is still quite well documented in textbooks,
            robust and 5 Volt-tolerant. Once we got this, the machinery park in the clean room allows us to shrink down to 500nm.

                                                       target="_blank">a paper called 'A Structured VHDL Design Method'</a> -
                which advocates the use of records for storing registers and the use of high-level functions to perform
                operations on these records. Some years ago I came across this paper and recognized this pattern as
                object-oriented programming (OOP), which spawned the following question:
              </p>
              <p>
                Could some higher level OOP language, say Python, be ~directly converted into OOP-VHDL for
                synthesis? Answer to this question has materialized as <a href="https://github.com/gasparka/pyha" target="_blank">Pyha</a>
                , with some additional features:
                <ul>
                <li>Cycle-accurate and fast simulator</li>
                <li>Debuggable in Python – very useful as Python and VHDL sources are highly correlated</li>
                <li>Simple testing framework by pairing pytest and cocotb</li>
                </ul>

          <h4><a name="chisel" href="#chisel"></a>Raising the level of abstraction in digital design with Chisel3 and FIRRTL</h4>
              <p>
                <a href="https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Chisel HDL</a> was created to make hardware designers
                more productive. As a DSL embedded in Scala, it provides designers the full power of functional and objected oriented
                programming. This has enabled designers to raise the level abstraction and thereby construct powerful, parameterized
                generators for digital designs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chisel was an important step forward, but it is only one piece of the larger puzzle. From using
                <a href="https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl" target="_blank">FIRRTL</a> to decouple design from
                implementation-specific information, to powerful parameterization with Diplomacy, this talk is about pushing the
                envelope of digital design.

          <h4> <a name="warpv" href="#warpv"></a>Formal Verification of WARP-V, a TL-Verilog RISC-V Core Generator</h4>
              <p>
                The presentation will briefly outline the motivation and difficulties behind designing and verifying a flexible,
                easily configurable RISC-V based processor, while showing how is it possible to solve the problems by using
                <a href="http://tl-x.org/" target="_blank">TL-Verilog</a> in design, and also in verification.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/stevehoover/warp-v" target="_blank">WARP-V</a> is a flexible CPU core generator
                written entirely in TL-Verilog using <a href="http://makerchip.com/" target="_blank">makerchip.com</a>. It supports
                RISC-V and custom ISAs and is currently capable of producing designs ranging from a non-pipelined, slow-clock,
                low-power microcontroller to a high-frequency, seven-stage CPU.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk introduces TL-Verilog and WARP-V and then describes the formal verification of WARP-V using
                <a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/riscv-formal" target="_blank">riscv-formal</a>, a formal verification
                framework for RISC-V by Clifford Wolf. Timing-abstraction and transaction-level design are showing significant
                benefits for hardware modeling, but this is the first demonstration of their benefits for verification modeling.
                As evidence of these benefits, the verification of all RISC-V configurations of WARP-V is accomplished in a
                single page of code.

            <a name="osvvm" href="#osvvm"></a>Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM):  Methodology, Library, and Models</h4>
              <p>
                Verification capability is largely a matter of programming. VHDL is a capable programming language. Like SystemVerilog,
                writing directly in VHDL is tedious and potentially error prone.
              </p>

              <a href="http://osvvm.org/" target="_blank">Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM)</a> is a methodology and
              library that simplifies the creation of structured testbenches that are readable and powerful. OSVVM supports the same
              capabilities that other verification languages (such as SystemVerilog + UVM) support – from a structured testbench
              framework using transaction level modeling, to functional coverage and randomized test generation, to scoreboards and
              FIFOs, to error handling utilities, to synchronization utilities, to memory modeling, and to verification components -
              All you need is OSVVM.

                 The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Plan 9 operating system</a> was
                 developed at Bell Labs in the 1980s using a new C compiler written by Ken Thompson,which has also been used to
                 implement the kernel of the Inferno OS and to bootstrap early releases of the Go language. Like Plan 9 itself,
                 the compiler is highly portable, elegantly minimalist, lightweight and quick. (The ARM version, for example,
                 is about 21,000 lines of code and compiles itself in seconds on a Raspberry Pi 3.) This talk will describe
                 the recent exercise of re-targeting the Plan 9 C compiler and associated toolchain for the RISC-V instruction set.

                     This year we're offering lightning talk and 15-minute speaking slots, with the
                     choice of opting in to be considered for an extended slot of 30-40 minutes. We
                     are intentionally reducing the standard speaking slot length this year to ensure
                     we can accomodate all of the exceptional talk submissions we recieve, and to
                     maximise face-to-face time throughout the event. We encourage speakers to skip
                     the technical deep-dive presentations and instead provide high-level
                     introductions and overviews of what makes their work great, and prepare a poster
                     or hardware demo for people to come and discuss details during the breaks.

                <a name="pulp"></a>Ten Years of PULP: The Evolution of the Species from IoT to HPC
              </h4>
              <p>
                With the increasing number of applications across various
                sectors such as IoT, consumer electronics, industrial
                automation, automotive, and high-performance computing silicon
                IPs leverage silicon IPs as fundamental building block for
                creating complex electronic systems. While the cost of accessing
                silicon has been decreasing due to the twilight of Moore's law,
                obtaining proprietary hardware IPs remains a significant
                obstacle for innovative start-ups and can also lead to supply
                chain challenges for larger companies. However, a recent surge
                in high-quality open-source hardware IPs offers a promising
                solution to overcome this barrier. These advancements pave the
                way for exciting applications in open-source electronics,
                potentially alleviating supply chain issues for global
                electronics system design companies. In this presentation, I
                will delve into the evolutionary journey of the open-source
                Parallel-Ultra-Low-Power (PULP) platform over the past decade
                exploring opportunities and challenges for next-generation
                open-source computing systems in a wide range of domains, from
                IoT to HPC.

              <p>
                Building a modern, complex, RISC-V based digital design like the
                Caliptra Root of Trust requires collaborative effort between
                multiple development teams of various backgrounds, especially in
                standards-based multi-organization environments like CHIPS
                Alliance.

                While in software development massive, standards-driven
                collaboration is a reality through open source infrastructure
                and tools, this success needs to be replicated in the hardware
                space with open source tooling to easily share and automate
                workflows, scale continuous integration and enable security
                through transparency of the development process.

                In this talk we will describe how digital design tools and
                workflows developed and used by CHIPS Alliance - including
                Verible, OpenROAD, cocotb, Verilator are being used in practice

              </h4>
              <p>
                In the past century, many discoveries have been made in the
                universe through radio astronomy. Several discoveries of recent
                years include Pulsars, Fast Radio Bursts and the magnetic
                interaction between stars and their planets. Contrary to an
                optical telescope, a radio telescope observes a range of radio
                signals outside the optical spectrum. Today's radio telescope
                systems consist of several to many antennas which are
                computationally combined into one large radio telescope.

                To enable more groundbreaking research, even better systems are
                needed to reveal more details of the universe. At the same time,
                there is a pressing need to improve the material cost and energy
                efficiency of systems. One of the biggest challenges we face
                today is efficient data movement from antenna receivers to the
                GPUs in the central processor that performs most of the
                computational work.

                This talk will first give an introduction in to radio telescope
                systems and will then discuss how an implementation with Remote
                Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) from
                FPGA to GPU can both improve the energy efficiency of radio
                telescope systems as well as enabling new science. The RoCE
                implementation on FPGA is under development and will be made
                available as open firmware."

                <a name="cache-coherence">Old School cache coherence - a snooping system for a multicore processor based on CVA6</a>
              </h4>
              <p>
                For many years now the computational power required by modern
                applications can only be offered by a collection of CPUs working
                together in a multicore processor. For these CPUs to process
                information correctly, it is necessary to implement mechanisms
                which guarantee that each core always uses an up-to-date version
                of the data: cache coherence protocols have been developed with
                this purpose. Years ago, when silicon technology could support
                the integration of only a handful of CPUs per chip, cache
                coherence was achieved by implementing bus snooping mechanisms;
                nowadays the propensity is to make use of directory-based cache
                coherence mechanisms, which guarantee excellent scalability, at
                the expense speed. This trend can be confirmed also by looking
                at the existing open-source implementations: there is not a
                single snooping mechanism. This is a problem, because many
                real-world scenarios would benefit from a low latency cache
                coherence unit, for example for all processors integrating a
                limited number of CPUs. With Culsans our goal is to cover this
                gap, by developing an open-source, tightly-coupled, low latency
                cache coherence unit for a quad-core processor based on the
                popular RISC-V CPU CVA6. In this presentation we show the
                architecture and the performance of the proposed
                implementation.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Abstract— Linting or rule-checking is a proven technique in RTL
                design and software domain to maintain high quality of code
                across distributed teams. SystemVerilog, the leading design
                verification language for chip designs will immensely benefit
                from such technology/process. However, lack of focus in EDA,
                wide variety of coding styles, and commercial factors have
                slowed down development of such tools in the past. We present
                our experience in building and deploying such lint tools based
                on a popular open-source platform slang/pyslang. As rules are
                developed in Python, it is very easy to customize it at finer
                granularity with reasonable cost. We also share how such rule
                checking can be integrated into a Continuous
                Integration/development (CI/CD) flow such as Git Actions.

              <h4>
                <a name="mathlib">MathLib - Math functions Library for SystemVerilog</a>
              </h4>
              <p>
                The importance of mathematical models in modern electronic-based
                systems across various domains such as automotive,
                telecommunication, gadgets, and medical cannot be overstated.
                These models play a central role in system design and are often
                created using tools like MATLAB© and Octave, which offer a wide
                range of built-in functions. However, hardware design,
                particularly the verification process, requires specialized
                skills and tools like SystemVerilog.

                To address this, we have developed a package called MathLib,
                which extends standard SystemVerilog to include mathematical
                function modeling. In this paper, we present a selection of
                MATLAB functions and their equivalents implemented in MathLib.
                This approach offers several key advantages:

                1. Native SystemVerilog implementation: By integrating
                mathematical functions directly into SystemVerilog, we eliminate
                the need for external tools or dependencies, streamlining the
                design process.

                2. Cost savings: Since MathLib enables native implementation in
                SystemVerilog, it eliminates the need for additional licenses or
                software, resulting in cost savings for the users.

                Furthermore, we provide a real-world example of how MathLib was
                utilized in one of our recent customer projects. We demonstrate
                how we employed MathLib to model complex equations within native
                SystemVerilog, showcasing its practical application.
                Additionally, we share insights from deploying this library in a
                few analog and mixed-signal (AMS) designs, specifically in the
                development of designs such as low-dropout regulators (LDOs) and
                low-pass filters (LPFs).

                Through this paper, we aim to highlight the benefits of using
                MathLib in SystemVerilog-based design projects, showcasing its
                capabilities and demonstrating its successful integration into
                various AMS designs.

              <p>
                Virtual Prototypes (VP) enable early software development and
                verification. Furthermore, they additionally VPs allow flexible
                hardware prototyping. Based on the SystemC hardware modeling
                language, VPs can offer fast simulations of complete hardware
                platforms (e.g., System-on-Chip (SoC)) executing bare metal
                applications, operating systems and more (10x to 100x faster
                than RTL simulations). With the Group of Computer Architecture
                (AGRA) at the University of Bremen, our research focuses on
                methods and techniques for the design and verification of
                VP-based Software and Hardware. To bridge the gap between the VP
                and the real-world Hardware, methods crossing the abstraction
                layers (e.g., from the VP to the RTL) is a promising approach
                for verification. While utilizing available open source tools,
                we take part in releasing our tooling as open source to enable
                further research and offer accessible educational tools (VPs,
                RTL implementation, verification tools, etc.). In this talk, we
                will give an overview of our recent workaround VPs, design and
                verification and how open source helps in research and
                education.

                <a name="graphical-approach">A Graphical Approach to Lightweight Block-Level Formal Verification</a></h4>
              <p>
                Shorter design cycles and the need for customized digital
                designs due to tight constraints on performance, power
                consumption, area, and security raise the risk of overlooked
                bugs. Traditional verification techniques based on simulation
                can only test a limited set of sequences and might fail to
                stimulate an error. Formal verification, on the other hand,
                explores the state space and proves a property exhaustively on
                the given design under the given assumptions. It can find rare
                corner-case issues within seconds and spot ambiguities in the
                specification. Arguing over whole classes of stimuli
                concurrently, however, requires different thinking and comes
                with a learning curve when used to simulation. We present a
                flow-chart-based methodology for lightweight block-level formal
                verification aimed at designers. We focus on open-source tools

              <p>
                This talk is about the landscape of visualizing and exploring
                the inside of microchips with open-source projects. Three
                manufacturable Process-Design-Kits (PDK) got published under
                open-source licenses so far and the count is increasing. These
                PDKs drive attention and workforce into open-source
                Electronic-Design-Automation (EDA) projects. Besides the
                well-known and recognized open-source EDA design flow tools
                (OpenRAOD and -LANE, Klayout, Magic, a.s.o) some smaller and
                niche projects enable new, creative and even innovative methods
                and provide tools for education. An overview and list of
                available and active tools and projects for visualizations will
                be given. You are free to use all of them without signing
                non-disclosure agreements (NDA) or buying high-priced licenses
                for your teaching, education, research and what else you want to
                make of it. Did you ever hold a 3D-printed AND-Cell in your
                hands? Do you want to fly through your rendered GDSII file? Some
                real-world examples to open up further discussions will be
                presented.

               <p>
                lowRISC is a not-for-profit organization headquartered in the UK
                whose mission is to make open source silicon a widely used
                commercial reality. We steward OpenTitan, an open silicon root
                of trust. Our engineers work in collaboration with OpenTitan
                partners to produce open RTL, DV, documentation and software
                developed live on our open repository
                (www.github.com/lowrisc/opentitan). We recently achieved a
                tape-out of our first engineering sample with chips expected in
                November in preparation for volume production.

                This talk gives an overview of lowRISC and the OpenTitan
                project, an update on our latest achievements and a look into
                our future plans. It includes details on some of our most
                interesting and significant IP (such as Ibex our RISC-V core)
                with pointers on how you can use it in your own designs.

                 <a name="verification-flow-asic"></a>A reusable verification, emulation and validation flow for ASIC design</h4>
               <p>
                In the conventional ASIC design life cycle, distinct teams are
                assigned to ASIC design/verification, firmware
                design/verification, and software development, leading to
                separate timelines and potential communication gaps.
                Consequently, issues detected during firmware or software phases
                can be challenging and expensive to correct.

                The presented reusable approach allows all teams to work
                concurrently, ensuring improved coordination and faster
                development cycles. Moreover, it facilitates the majority of the
                work to be completed even before the final silicon is ready,
                resulting in a more robust and efficient ASIC design process.

                We present a practical implementation of an reusable design flow
                that uses open-source tools.

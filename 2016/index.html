	    </a>Open-source Hardware: Opportunities and Challenges</h4>
	  <p>
	    Innovation in hardware is slowing due to rising costs of chip design and diminishing beneﬁts
	    from Moore’s law and Dennard scaling. Software innovation, on the other hand, is ﬂourishing,
	    helped in good measure by a thriving open-source ecosystem. We believe that open source can
	    similarly help hardware innovation, but has not yet due to several reasons. We identify these
	    reasons and how the industry, academia, and the hardware community at large can come together
	    to address them. <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01980v2.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Computer paper</a>.

	  <p>
	    <a href="https://twitter.com/boom_cpu" target="_blank">BOOM</a> is an open source superscalar
	    out-of-order RISC-V core that is roughly equivalent in performance
	    and area to a Cortex A9 or A15 processor. BOOM supports the full RV64G RISC-V ISA (including the
	    Privileged and External Debug specifications), provides good single-thread performance competitive with
	    contemporary processors, is written in a free and open hardware construction language (Chisel), targets
	    both ASIC and FPGA flows, and is accompanied by an open source design specification.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In this talk we will discuss some of the latest updates to BOOM and the larger Rocket-chip SoC ecosystem
	    that BOOM integrates with. We will also discuss the new Chisel3 hardware construction language and its
	    new FIRRTL-based (a <strong>F</strong>lexible <strong>IR</strong> for <strong>RTL</strong>) flow, which
	    helps open up the world of writing compiler passes to hardware designers for fun and profit.

	  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> is a free and open source Verilog synthesis tool and more.
	    It gained prominence last year because of its role as synthesis tool
	    in the <a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/" target="_blank">Project IceStorm</a> FOSS Verilog-to-bitstream flow for <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40.aspx" target="_blank">iCE40
	    FPGAs</a>. This presentation however dives into the Yosys-SMTBMC formal
	    verification flow that can be used for verifying formal properties
	    using bounded model checks and/or temporal induction.
	  </p>
	  <p>The presentation covers practical examples of how to set up and use the
	    flow, but also touches on in-depth topics such as the scheme used by
	    Yosys-SMTBMC to encode a temporal circuit problem using the SMT-LIB
	    v2.5 language (utilizing uninterpreted functions and user-declared sorts).

	    <a name="pulp" class="anchor" href="#pulp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>PULP: an open source Parallel Ultra-Low-Power computing platform</h4>
	  <p><a href="http://www.pulp-platform.org/" target="_blank">PULP</a> is a RISC-V
	    based multi-core platform that leverages near-threshold computing
	    and multi-core parallelism to provide high performance and energy efficiency while
	    maintaining the flexibility and programmability typical of instruction processors to
	    target requirements of a number of high-growth near-sensor processing Internet of
	    Things (IoT) applications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    PULP supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP" target="_blank">OpenMP</a>,
	    <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/" target="_blank">OpenCL</a> and
	    <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openvx/" target="_blank">OpenVX</a> parallel
	    programming models on top of GCC
	    and LLVM toolchains. A virtual platform allows early application development and debug,
	    while a RTL cycle accurate Xilinx Zynq-based FPGA emulation platform with support for
	    debug and instruction tracing is available for development and benchmarking of
	    real-life applications. An expansion board for Zynq integrating several sensors,
	    including low power imagers, MEMS microphones, and accelerometers, has been developed
	    to emulate real-life application environments.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Multiple silicon implementations of
	    PULP have been taped out in several technology nodes and achieve hundreds of GOPS/W on
	    video, audio, inertial sensor data processing and classification, within power envelopes
	    of a few milliwatts. PULP hardware and software are open-source with the goal of supporting
	    and boosting an innovation ecosystem focusing on ULP computing for the IoT.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The purpose of this talk is to present recent evolutions of PULP to the ORCONF community,
	    with the goal of sharing the hardware/software PULP infrastructure, as well as silicon
	    prototypes and application boards.

	    <a name="zipcpu" class="anchor" href="#zipcpu"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>The ZipCPU: A resource efficient 32-bit SoftCore</h4>
	  <p>Now that FPGAs have become powerful and ubiquitous enough, there
	    exist many soft core CPUs that can be placed within FPGAs to
	    accomplish sequential tasks. Among these are the proprietary CPU's
	    Microblaze and Nios, as well as the open CPUs of OpenRISC and RISC-V.
	    These CPUs, however, tend to be built with the generic purpose of
	    turning an FPGA into a high quality CPU, rather than complementing
	    the FPGA's strength by augmenting some specialized FPGA algorithm
	    with some amount of sequential logic. This focus can be seen in both
	    the area these CPUs take up, as well as the complexity of their
	    interface to the rest of the FPGA's logic and memory.
	  </p>
	  <p>In contrast,
	    the <a href="http://opencores.org/project,zipcpu" target="_blank">ZipCPU</a> has been designed from the ground up with a focus on
	    simplified logic and on-chip interaction. It does this by using a
	    stripped down instruction set, as well as a stripped down interrupt
	    and wishbone bus model. This allows the ZipCPU to fit within the
	    small spaces left over within larger designs, as exemplified by the
	    fact that it can easily fit within a Spartan-LX4, using only 1215 LUTs.

          <p>
	    System-on-Chip are more and more complex and finding
	    functional errors (bugs) or performance bottlenecks can be
	    very time-consuming and frustrating. The well-known
	    methodology of gdb-like run-control debugging is limited
	    when it comes to observation of a running SoC to discover
	    concurrency problems and other effects. Trace debugging
	    has gained importance, where the processor and other SoC
	    components emit trace events during execution.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Even though debug infrastructure is an essential part
	    of any SoC design, most people consider creating it more
	    of a necessary chore than an exciting endeavor and
	    especially for open source projects a good debug
	    infrastructure is often not considered important
	    enough.

	    Although recent manycore architectures (e.g. Intel SCC, Kalray MPPA)
	    offer hardware support for message passing, it is still costly: the
	    sender writes the message in its local memory, a DMA transfer is used

	    signalling mechanism is used to notify the receiver.

	    <a href="https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx" target="_blank">mor1kx</a>,
	    the fastest version of its pipeline called 'Cappuccino'.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To understand what happens inside the Cappuccino, we implemented
	    Performance Counter Unit (PCU) according to the OpenRISC design
	    specification, and we suggest extensions to this specification in
	    order to make performance evaluation process more effective.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The branch predictor module is chosen as a case study to test our approach
	    in performance tuning for 'Cappuccino', testing included implementation
	    of several branch predictors in verilog and additional evaluation in the
	    software framework with different branch predictors running traces of real
	    programs obtained from mor1kx Cappuccino: static, saturation counter,
	    gshare, bimodal, perceptron, etc.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We overview problems and difficulties of the existing infrastructure
	    we encountered during our efforts and suggest ways to make the whole
	    process easier for further researches.

	    </a>Modules, hardware and JavaScript</h4>
	  <p>
	    This talk provides an overview about building embedded systems with JavaScript.
	    By using a high-level language such as JavaScript has the potential to further
	    democratize hardware development.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    First, hardware with 32-bit based CPUs are discussed. Then, some libraries
	    are discussed and a how events from hardware can be processed.

	    </a>Application development co-design for FPGA-accelerated data center HPC servers</h4>
	  <p>
	    Scaling the number of cores cannot meet any longer HPC servers
	    performance requirements within power and general costs constraints.
	    As a result, there is a growing interest in the use of FPGAs as an HPC
	    platform with dramatically reduce energy requirements.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two essential ingredients of this strategy, which is pursued by all
	    key FPGA providers, are the availability of both state-of-the-art
	    compilation, performance analysis and debugging tools, and of a
	    variety of libraries with off-the-shelp pre-optimized commonly used
	    algorithms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We report the results of one such effort, supported by Xilinx, that
	    is aimed at implementing HPC algorithms, modeled in OpenCL, on an FPGA
	    platform via High-Level Synthesis. The OpenCL kernels and the synthesis
	    scripts are made available as open-source in order to seed the
	    development of the eco-system.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We present preliminary results that demonstrate the development flow as
	    well as the energy efficiency gains.

	    </a>A Cost-effective System for Neuroscientific Research</h4>
	  <p>
	    In recent times, the fields of EEG application have widened from
	    those typical of the clinical setting to include Brain-Computer
	    Interfaces (BCI) and also consumer-oriented applications ranging
	    from home care to neurofeedback and gaming controllers. There is
	    therefore a demand for high-quality acquisition systems whose
	    montage is fast and does not require trained personnel.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For these reasons we developed an open-source cost-effective,
	    quick-setup <a href="http://www.arces.unibo.it/en/research/microsystems/smart-sensors-and-interfaces-1/copy_of_index.html"
			   target="_blank">EEG acquisition system</a> which
	    can be plugged on the
	    top of an Arduino board. Together with the board we developed a
	    Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) that can be used to
	    acquire, filter, visualize and store EEG signals in real-time
	    and a set of libraries which allows to interface the device with
	    BCI tools.

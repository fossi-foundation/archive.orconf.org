	  <p>We're pleased to announce that ORCONF 2015 will be held between <strong>October 9 to October 11</strong> at <a target="_blank" href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about">CERN</a>, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in <strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>.</p>

	  <p>ORCONF is an open source digital design and embedded systems conference, covering areas of electronics from the transistor level up to Linux user space and beyond. Expect presentations and discussion on free and open source IP projects, implementations on FPGA and in silicon, verification, EDA tools, licensing and embedded software, to name a few.</p>
	  <p>Begun as the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://openrisc.io">OpenRISC</a> developers and users conference, it has become a broad open source digital design-oriented event. This year ORCONF is run as a <em>Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi)</em> event, further broadening its remit, and as such will include a <a target="_blank" href="http://lowrisc.org"><strong>lowRISC</strong></a> workshop on the Friday.</p>

	  <h4><a name="aap" class="anchor" href="#aap"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AAP: An Altruistic Processor</h4>
	  <p>An Altruistic Processor (AAP) is a free and open source processor ISA,
	    intended as reference architecture to improve software tool chain
	    support for small, deeply embedded Harvard architectures.  These are
	    still in very widespread use (for example the Atmel AVR architecture),
	    but compiler tool chains often suffer from assuming all targets are 32-
	    or 64-bit Von Neumann RISC architectures with many registers (such as
	    ARM).</p>
	  
	  <p>AAP is a 16-bit Harvard architecture, with a 24-bit word addressed code
	    space.  It can be configured with as few as four 16-bit registers and
	    has an extensible instruction set offering 16-bit, 32-bit and longer
	    instructions.  It thus provides a robust test of the generality of
	    modern compiler tool chains.</p>
	  
	  <p>Embecosm has implemented a LLVM tool chain and instruction set simulator
	    for AAP, and is in the process of creating FPGA implementations in
	    Verilog for the DE0-Nano.</p>
	  
	  <p>In this talk, we will explain in detail the feature and philosophy of
	    AAP as well as some software features we aim to improve through this
	    project.  We will present the implementation of both the ISS and the
	    FPGA designs, one of which is a simple student implementation, and the
	    other a superscalar pipelined implementation.</p>

	  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> (Yosys Open Synthesis Suite) is an open source project aiming at
	    creating a fully-featured HDL synthesis tool, and more. Lately a lot of
	    features related to formal verification have been added to Yosys.</p>

	  <p>Project IceStorm aims at documenting the bit-stream format of Lattice iCE40
	    FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bit-stream
	    files, including a tool that converts iCE40 bit-stream files into Verilog.</p>

	  <p>Arachne-PNR is a place&amp;route tool based on the databases provided by

  	  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://potential.ventures/cocotb/">Cocotb</a> is a coroutine based cosimulation library for writing VHDL and Verilog testbenches in Python.</p>
  	  <p>
  	      Using Python for functional verification makes it possible to

	  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in/shakti.html">SHAKTI</a> is a family of processors based on the RISC-V ISA and targets all the major segments
of the processor spectrum, ranging from IoT class controllers to server/HPC class server parts.
One of the class in series of processors, the I-Class is aimed at mobile and desktop environments. The design is highly parametrized  to facilitate quick design space exploration. It is an Out-of-Order core, with pipeline depth of 8 stages, based on merged register file approach.</p>

	  <p>Another class of series of processors, the F-Class, employs ECC to tolerate errors in registers and memories and uses space and time redundancy based techniques to tolerate errors in ALU.</p>

	  <p>In this talk, we will present the design and performance characteristics of I-Class processor and fault tolerant techniques employed in ALU of the F-Class.</p>

	  <h4><a name="rcmc" class="anchor" href="#rcmc"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reduced Complexity ManyCore (RC/MC)</h4>
	  <p>The RC/MC architecture consists of a large number of small RISC-V
	    processor cores that are connected by the real-time capable PaterNoster
	    Network-on-Chip. In contrast to conventional multicores there is no
	    shared memory or cache hierarchy. Instead, each core has a small private
	    memory and communicates with the other cores via explicit fine grained
	    messages.</p>
	  <p>
	    Small cores provide a high performance/Watt ratio and a good timing
	    predictability. Therefore we investigate, if the RC/MC architecture can
	    provide the same performance as conventional shared memory multicores
	    with lower energy consumption and better real-time capabilities.

	  <h4><a name="opa" class="anchor" href="#opa"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OPA: Out-of-Order Superscalar Soft CPU</h4>
	  <p>OPA is an out-of-order superscalar processor designed for FPGAs.
	    Compared to a traditional ASIC, an FPGA does not have ready access to
	    multiported memory, content-addressable memory, or fast combinatoric
	    circuitry.  On the other hand, memory is much faster compared to core
	    clock rate.  The cost of a cache miss to DDR on a 4GHz ASIC is more than
	    an order of magnitude more serious than a cache miss to DDR from an
	    FPGA-based design.
	  </p>
	  <p>The primary challenge in the design of OPA has been finding circuits
	    which are simple enough to run at a reasonable clock rate on an FPGA.
	    Of particular note is the wakeup-select circuit which schedules
	    instructions for execution once their dependants are available.  OPA
	    manages this using novel shift and mux circuit with one ready bit and
	    two muxes per pending instruction.  While a traditional out-of-order
	    design uses a separate reorder buffer and instruction scheduler, the low
	    cache miss penalty makes it possible for OPA to use a simple unified
	    circuit for both.
	  </p>
	  <p>As FPGAs come in many different sizes, so too must OPA. At synthesis
	    time, one can select the number of execution units, the scheduler window
	    size, and the supported instruction set (currently only LM32 or RV32M).
	    On a low-end Cyclone V, a 4-decode 3-issue processor which schedules up
	    28-instructions at once can run at 125MHz in 10k ALMs.  The smallest
	    configuration costs 4k, but there is no upper limit on the issue width
	    and cost.  However, OPA does not yet include a TLB or ITTAGE predictor,
	    so these costs will increase.

	  <p>Running a complete Linux system directly in the Web browser? Why?
	    Just because it's possible or does it have some real world applications?
	    In this talk we will address this question for the emulator jor1k.
	    jor1k for the OpenRISC architecture started as as a pure fun Open Source
	    project with less than 1500 lines of code but has now become the fastest
	    and most flexible Linux emulator for the Web.
	  </p>
	  <p>This year jor1k was part of the Google's GSoC program in order to implement the RISC-V CPU.
	    Hence, this talk will not only address the question above, but will especially focus on the inner working of jor1k,
	    the new RISC-V implementation and several subsystems like network support and the unique filesystem.

	  <h4><a name="lowrisc" class="anchor" href="#lowrisc"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An update on the lowRISC open source System-on-Chip</h4>
	  <p>The lack of a secure, flexible, high performance, and silicon-proven open
	    source base for SoC designs holds back innovation and rate-of-progress in the
	    semiconductor industry. The not-for-profit lowRISC project aims to rectify
	    this, building on the open RISC-V instruction set architecture and exploring
	    ideas on improving security via tagged memory and increasing flexibility
	    through the addition of RISC-V 'Minion' cores to implement soft peripherals.
	    Put simply, lowRISC aims to become the Linux of the hardware world.
	    This talk will give an update on our efforts and our path to first
	    silicon and low cost development boards (Raspberry Pi for
	    grownups!), including how the open source community at large can get involved.
	    </p>
	  <p>While the potential advantages of open-source software have been clearly
	    demonstrated, the benefits remain untapped in the semiconductor industry. We
	    believe there are significant gains in promoting the open development of
	    hardware without imposing restrictions on its modification or use. Today, it
	    would be almost inconceivable to start work on a large software project
	    without building on an existing open-source base. lowRISC and the wider
	    open-source hardware movement will have succeeded when the same can be said of
	    new projects in the semiconductor industry.

	  <h4><a name="rumpkernel" class="anchor" href="#rumpkernel"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TCP/IP Offload to Minion Cores using Rump Kernel</h4>
	  <p>Rump kernels are a framework for running the free, portable, and
	    production-quality NetBSD drivers and subsystems on various platforms. As part
	    of this year's lowRISC Summer of Code, rump kernels were ported to bare-metal
	    RISC-V. The purpose of the port was to use rump kernels on the so-called
	    minion cores, lowRISC's peripheral I/O processors. As an example application,
	    a prototype for offloading TCP/IP to the rump kernel is presented, but the
	    concept and implementation are reusable and fit other applications just as well.
	  </p>
	  <p>This talk will present the work done in this LSoC project, but also give a
	    general introduction to rump kernels and how they can be used in other similar
	    scenarios.

	    fast simulation using LLVM, waveform viewing and co-simulation with
	    Icarus Verilog are provided.
	  </p>
	  <p>HardCaml-RiscV is a simple pipelined RV32I core, targetted towards a
	    FPGA implementation and built with HardCaml.  Future plans include
	    various configurable features.
	  </p>
	  <p>HardCaml-ZINC builds on HardCaml-RiscV to provide an efficient
	    execution environment for running OCaml bytecode programs on FPGAs.
	    Features include a simple scheme to reduce interpreter overhead,
	    acceleration of common operations and addition of cpu state to suit
	    the stack based architecture.
	  </p>
	  <p>A fun project goal is to get the HardCaml-ZINC design running on an
	    FPGA and to generate the source code that built it so it can bootstrap
	    itself (sort of!).

	  <h4><a name="cosmicpi" class="anchor" href="#cosmicpi"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cosmic PI</h4>
	  <p>CosmicPi is an open source project aiming at creating a low cost and fully open source detector for cosmic rays. The project aims to create a distributed cosmic ray telescope by networking individual pixels located across the globe. Charged particles created by the collision of cosmic rays with constituents of the atmosphere deposit energy in a low cost plastic scintillator. The energy is converted into photons by the material, which are then trapped by wavelength shifting optical fibres to bring the light generated to two silicon photomultipliers. Two sensors are located at opposite ends of the scintillator in order to provide coincidence detection of events. An open hardware front end, including amplifier, pulse shaper and trigger functionality is currently under development. Control of the device and data acquisition is handled by an Arduino DUE, which provides JSON formatted output to a Raspberry Pi for analysis and upload to the detector network. The CosmicPi architecture includes a comprehensive array of environmental sensors including barometer, accelerometer, magnetometer, relative humidity and GPS to allow citizens and scientists alike to study how cosmic rays interact with the world around us.
